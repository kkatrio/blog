I was working on this for months. I studied reinforment learning a lot, I read [books](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39813875-reinforcement-learning), attented online [courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0), I was just so much interested in it. I used Tensorflow to build the neural network and tkinter for the graphics. When I managed to train the snake and saw it growing, I felt satisfied and worried at the same time!
